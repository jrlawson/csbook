=S3 Market Models=
<h3>Problem</h3>
We would like to be able to understand market opportunities while they are still
opportunities and can still be taken advantage of. The issue is that there are
so many possibilities to test that it can take longer to find the opportunities
than the opportunities last. We'd like to develop different ways to look at
opportunities, so that if an opportunity looks good from multiple angles, it's
likely to be better than an opportunity that only looks good when you look at 
it in a certain way.
