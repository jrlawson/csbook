      <h2>Project Specific SBT Scripts</h2>
      There are some SBT scripts provided in the <code>scripts/</code> directory 
      for some common tasks. These scripts can be run from the command line by 
      simply piping them to SBT from the project's root directory. For instance:
      
      <blockquote>
         sbt < scripts/HelloWorld.script
      </blockquote>
      
      The intent is that these scripts be exceedingly simple. The available 
      scripts include:
      <p>
      
      <ol>
         <li>
            <b>HelloWorld.script</b> : A script to run a "Hello World!"
            program. Useful to verify that the Scala ecosystem is working. It
            should print out something like: <p>
            <blockquote>
              scala> val res0: String = Hello World from Scala and SBT!
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            This script has essentially no dependencies and doesn't compile any 
            of our program code. So if Scala and SBT are setup and nothing else, 
            it should work. If it doesn't work, there is a basic configuration 
            management problem.<p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <b>HelloWorldTest.script</b> : A script to run a single unit test
            that simply calls the "Hello World!" program. This program should
            work if Scala, SBT, and ScalaTest are working together. So it's 
            basically a test to verify that ScalaTest is configured properly
            within SBT. The single test should pass.<p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <b>MakeWebsite.script</b> : A script to generate all of the HTML
            files that go into the website describing this product, its code,
            its tests, and other product resources.<p>
         </li>
      </ol>
