    <em>Use Case Name: </em> Use Case Name
    <p>

    <em>User Story:</em><p>
    Brief description of the use case, in non-technical terms. The narrative should describe why the actors want to
    do this use case. What grabs them, motivates them, and why they'd pay to do this.
    <p>

    <em>Success Criteria:</em><p>
    Things that need to happen to deliver value to stakeholders. For instance, in the case of an Automatic Teller
    Machine, the success criteria for a “withdraw cash” use case might be (from the account holder’s perspective)
    “the correct amount of cash was provided to the account holder” These success criteria need to fall within the
    scope of the system. If they fall outside the scope of this system they are not success criteria for this use
    case, or the use case may be part of another system.
    <p>

    <em>Minimum Requirements:</em><p>
    Things that need to be guaranteed (to a participating stakeholder) even if we fail to meet success criteria.
    Guarantees that the stakeholder’s need before they even attempt the use case. E.g. from the bank’s perspective,
    “If the account holder gets cash, the account will be debited by that amount”, or from the account holder’s
    perspective, “if the account is debited, the amount of the debit is provided in cash”
    <p>

    <em>Preconditions:</em><p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Things that need to be in place before the use case starts.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <em>Post-conditions:</em><p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Things that need to be in place when the use case ends (e.g. transactional semantics).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <em>Actors:</em><p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Primary—</em> Instantiates the use case. Usually, but not always a stakeholder
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Secondary—</em> Becomes involved with the system later (optional).
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Off stage—</em> Holds a stake without interacting with the system (optional).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <em>Mapping: Stakeholders -> Value Upon Success:</em>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <em>Abstraction Level:</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud : “Product vision”, for instance “Forever free the user from the drudgery of housework”</li>
        <li>Kite: “Conceptual”, for instance “Self-cleaning oven”</li>
        <li>Surface : A use case that makes sense to a user</li>
        <li>Fish : A use case that has value to an implementer of the system but may lack relevance for its user (few of these)</li>
        <li>Clam: Fine-grain detail use case, for instance where precise definition of an algorithm is important (very few of these)</li>
    </ul>
